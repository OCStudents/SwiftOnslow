This package contains helper functions to ease the transition from Python to Swift. These functions may be used as part of tasks and assignments in Onslow College's 13DTC program.

## Usage

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/OnslowCollege/SwiftOnslow.git", .branch("main")),

**Note:** this dependency is already added to Onslow College's [Swift template](https://github.com/onslowcollege/swift-template). No need to add it manually!
